**Cat-Pass** lets you password-protect categories.
**Caution:** deactivating the plugin will render your protected posts visible again.

== Description ==

For some reason or other, you might want to allow access to certain posts only to certain people. You can use password-protection on Pages and Posts, but those need to be set individually.
It's far simpler to just write a Post, specify a category and all posts in that category are password protected. Or you might decide to protect a lot of old posts.
Imagine a family blog where certain posts are only visible to people who know the birthday of your first child, or remember your pet's name.
Cat-Pass is not for super-sensitive information, it's for casual use.

1. Download Cat-Pass
